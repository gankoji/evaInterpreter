# evaInterpreter
This contains the implementation of an interpreter for the small language "Eva",
from Dmitry Soshnikov's "Essentials of Interpretation"
[course](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/essentials-of-interpretation/).

Of course, I'm using Python here instead of Javascript/node, but overall the
effect should be the same. I've chosen to use PyTest to help manage all the test
code, since it makes life so easy in that respect.
